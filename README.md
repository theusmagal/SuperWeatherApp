# SuperWeatherApp 🌦️

This project is part of the Web Programming course. I implemented a weather application using multiple features and multiple weather forecast APIs. It allows users to find any city, use their current location and view more informationforecast with a nice and responsive interface. 

## ✨ Features

✅ Search for weather by city name  
✅ Use current location with the Geolocation API  
✅ Compare 24-hour forecasts from **OpenWeather** and **WeatherAPI** side by side  
✅ Show current weather: temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed  
✅ Display a 24-hour **hourly forecast** with icons and temperatures  
✅ Display a **7-day forecast** with daily icons and temperatures  
✅ Colorful background gradient based on temperature: cold, warm, or hot  
✅ Dynamic chart with Chart.js comparing temperatures of both APIs  
✅ Save favorite cities using localStorage  
✅ Toggle between °C, °F, and Kelvin units
